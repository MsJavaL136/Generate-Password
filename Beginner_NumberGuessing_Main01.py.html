# (congrats user_name, you win after "str(tries)'' tries"  

# 怎解print(" 'You did not guess the number. It was' str(Secretnumber)")???
                                                             
#注意 variable, INTEGER, string TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'
#experiment, let you did not guess the number appear only AFTER the line guess is too high     

# import the random module for generation of random numbers
